# Run the live-Postgres integration tests (marked @pytest.mark.integration),
# which are excluded from the default suite / CI.
#
# The tests are DESTRUCTIVE: any database you point them at has its `dwh` schema
# dropped and recreated (usvote.load's replace=True path), plus a `usvote_test`
# schema created/dropped. This script therefore defaults to a throwaway database
# (usvote_test), refuses to run against `elections`, and refuses any OTHER
# pre-existing database it did not create unless ALLOW_EXISTING_DB=1 is set — so
# your real data warehouse is never touched by accident.
#
# The postgres password is never stored: it is read from an interactive prompt
# (silently, not echoed, not in shell history) unless USVOTE_TEST_DB_PASSWORD is
# already exported. Do not hardcode it here or commit it anywhere.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/run_integration_tests.sh                 # prompts for password, runs
#   USVOTE_TEST_DB_NAME=my_db scripts/run_integration_tests.sh
#   scripts/run_integration_tests.sh -k some_test    # extra args pass to pytest
#
# Overridable via env (defaults shown):
#   USVOTE_TEST_DB_HOST=localhost
#   USVOTE_TEST_DB_PORT=5432
#   USVOTE_TEST_DB_NAME=usvote_test
#   USVOTE_TEST_DB_USER=postgres
#   USVOTE_TEST_DB_PASSWORD   (prompted if unset)
#   KEEP_TEST_DB=1            keep the throwaway DB afterwards (default: drop it)
#   ALLOW_EXISTING_DB=1       allow a non-default DB that already exists (opt-in)
