"""EC<->PV join — EC-left join of the resolved PV series onto the EC spine (#69, D026).

This is the seam the analysis (E7 hybrid) and the API (E8) build on. It joins the
**resolved** popular-vote series (``pv_preferred`` for analysis, ``pv_redistributable``
for the API — never the raw ``dwh.pv_votes`` union, which would fan the 1976–2024
overlap out 2× and double-count every downstream sum/margin, D017) onto the Electoral
College spine, producing one row per ``(year, state, candidate)`` — the **canonical
grain** (D006 / :mod:`usvote.transform` canonical keys).

**Why EC-left (D026, corrected).** The EC ``votes`` fact is **dense**: the Archives
Table 2 prints ``-`` for "won no electoral votes here" and the parser reads it as ``0``
(:func:`usvote.parse.parse_t2_votes_by_state`), so every getter has a state row in every
participating state — a loser is an explicit ``president_electoral_votes = 0`` row,
not a
missing one (verified rectangular across all 49 years; ~59% of state rows are such
0-rows, now guarded by :func:`usvote.transform.assert_rectangular_state_grain`). So a
plain **EC-left** join already keeps every loser's per-state row — the "lost the EC, won
the PV" rows this project's thesis explores — with the national rank/``took_office``
already broadcast onto the state rows by the transform. (An earlier draft used a FULL
OUTER "participant" view on the false premise that the fact was *sparse* and losers were
dropped; the PV-only arm of that join was provably dead, since every PV key is scoped to
an EC-getter (D007) in a participating state (D024) and so always matches a dense EC row
— see the corrected D026.)

A getter with no PV (pre-1976, or a faithless/unpledged getter with no popular vote)
keeps **NULL PV** — an honest D005 gap, never a fabricated value. The one thing EC-left
must guard is its silent-drop footgun: a PV row whose ``(year, state, candidate)``
matches
**no** EC row is dropped by the LEFT JOIN, so :func:`assert_db_pv_matches_ec` runs as a
view-creation precondition and fails loud with the offending keys (the reciprocal
coverage
guard #69 owns per ``docs/canonical-keys.md`` — now fact-level, strictly stronger than a
dim-membership check).

**Module placement.** This lives at the top level (a sibling of :mod:`usvote.spine`),
**not** under ``usvote/pv/``: it names ``dwh.votes``/``dwh.candidate`` (EC star-schema
knowledge), and the greppable invariant *nothing under ``src/usvote/pv/`` mentions
``dwh.votes``* forbids ``pv/``. Its precedent is :mod:`usvote.spine` — an EC-domain
module a PV/consumer stage reads *from* (D006 makes EC authoritative), not the reverse.

Two testable expressions of the same policy, mirroring :mod:`usvote.pv.views`: the SQL
builder (unit-tested as a string, drives the live views) and the pure-pandas oracle
:func:`join_ec_pv` (run on small fixtures offline and re-run against the live view).
