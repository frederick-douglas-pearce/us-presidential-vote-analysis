"""Database access — the ``DBC`` psycopg2 wrapper.

Thin wrapper around psycopg2 for schema/table create + drop, DataFrame inserts
(``execute_values``), and query-to-DataFrame reads. This is the one importable
module the whole pipeline loads through.

Ported from the top-level ``db_tools.py`` in E1-S3 (#21): type hints added and
SQL-string construction brought under unit test. Behavior matches the original
with one intentional change — a failed connection now raises
:class:`DBConnectionError` instead of calling ``sys.exit(1)``. Raising a typed
exception is both testable and friendlier inside the notebook (a clear
traceback rather than a killed kernel).

        back on error) — one statement, one commit. Inside this block that per-statement
        commit is suppressed: the writes run on a bare cursor and accumulate, and this
        manager issues a **single** ``commit()`` on clean exit or ``rollback()`` on any
        exception. So a multi-table load (the D024 roster + fact pair in
        :func:`usvote.ucsb.pipeline.run_ucsb_pipeline`, the EC star-schema's three

        ``replace`` rebuild leaves the previous warehouse intact rather than
        dropped-and-half-built.

        early), so this raises rather than reference-count. Keep network/scrape and
        heavy transforms *outside* the block; wrap only the DB-write phase, so a slow
        fetch never holds a transaction (and its locks) open.

        ``close`` is deliberately not handled here — a loader closing the connection
