"""Transform & validate stage — parsed UCSB pages -> PV facts + the absence roster.

The UCSB analogue of :mod:`usvote.mit.transform`, and E4-S3 (#36). It takes the
:class:`~usvote.ucsb.parse.ParsedUCSBYear` records :mod:`usvote.ucsb.parse` emits and
produces **two** frames:

- **PV facts** on the D018 shared shape (:data:`~usvote.pv.schema.SHARED_PV_COLUMNS`),
  interchangeable with MIT's at load; and
- the **`pv_state_status` roster** (:data:`~usvote.pv.status.ROSTER_COLUMNS`) — one row
  per ``(source, year, state)`` for *every* state in that year's election, which is
  what makes popular-vote absence representable at all (D024 §3).

Everything here is pure and offline. The roster's only legitimate inputs are the **EC
spine** and :data:`UCSB_NONPARTICIPATING_STATES` (D024 §6) — never UCSB markup — and
the spine arrives by **dependency injection** as a frame, never a query, so the whole
roster including its two-way assert stays in the offline unit suite.

**Three things this stage owns that nothing upstream can.**

1. **All three ``pv_status`` values.** The parser emits only ``legislature_chosen``, the
   sole status readable from markup. ``not_participating`` has no markup whatsoever (the
   row is simply absent), and ``popular_vote`` is the **residual** — a roster state the
   parser did not flag and the constant does not list. All three are therefore assigned
   here, in one place, against the complete roster.
2. **State-label canonicalization**, via :data:`UCSB_STATE_RECONCILIATIONS`. #35 emits
   verbatim labels by design; the roster is keyed on ``dwh.state``'s canonical PK, so
   this must precede anything roster-related or the assert reports every label variant
   as a phantom state. (#38 keeps **candidate**-name reconciliation.)
3. **The cross-page two-way assert**
   (:func:`usvote.pv.status.assert_roster_covers_facts`), which needs the EC spine
   the parser deliberately cannot see.

**Ordering is load-bearing**, and each step is enforced by a test:

1. **Scope years first**, and raise if an in-scope year has no parsed page — otherwise
   the roster builds ~40 ``popular_vote`` states for it with zero facts, and the assert
   reports one missing page as forty mismatched states.
2. **Canonicalize before everything roster-related** (above). Canonicalization is a
   many-to-one rewrite, so it also *reopens* the state-vs-status overlap hole
   :func:`usvote.ucsb.parse._assert_one_status_per_state` closed on **verbatim** labels
   (``New jersey`` as a vote row beside ``New Jersey`` as a status row would collapse
   onto one state). It is therefore re-asserted here on canonical labels — the same
   reason :mod:`usvote.mit.reconcile` re-runs its grain check after its rewrite.
3. **Detect status contradictions on the *input sets*, before assembling the roster.**
   The builder's precedence chain resolves a contradictory state to one row with one
   status, destroying the evidence; a check that ran afterwards would pass on a frame
   built by silently resolving exactly what D024 says must raise.

**What is deliberately not here:** candidate-name reconciliation and the D007
candidate-scope filter (both #38 — see :func:`_build_pv_votes`); the DDL and load (#37);
NaN -> None (owned once at the DB write boundary, never an upstream ``.map``).

    prints. Totals and margins are unaffected (``state_total_votes`` is carried
    verbatim, never re-summed), but the *candidate* grain differs by source — and #38
    must **re-run** the two-way assert after narrowing, since dropping candidates can
    empty a ``(year, state)`` and turn a ``popular_vote`` state into a zero-fact one.

    disagrees with its published *votes over total* beyond

    Pinning every row ``exact`` would assert something demonstrably false for the four

    The tolerance is **imported** from the parser rather than restated, and the known
