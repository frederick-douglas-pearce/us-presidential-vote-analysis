"""Reconcile stage — UCSB candidate names onto the canonical key + the D007 scope.

The UCSB ``reconcile`` seam, sibling to :mod:`usvote.ucsb.transform` and the analogue
of :mod:`usvote.mit.reconcile` (source-namespacing convention, D015). It takes the D018
shared-PV frame :func:`usvote.ucsb.transform.transform_ucsb` emits — whose ``candidate``
is still UCSB-native and still carries *every* named column UCSB prints — and does the
two things #38 owns that #36 left open (see the ``_build_pv_votes`` docstring):

1. **rewrite ``candidate`` onto the canonical EC candidate key** (D006, #30) — the
   reconciled full ``name`` the Electoral-College spine defines (e.g. ``J. Strom
   Thurmond``, ``John C. Frémont``); and
2. **apply the D007 candidate scope** — keep only candidates who *received electoral
   votes*, dropping the popular-vote-only minors (Debs 1912, Perot 1992/1996, Nader
   2000, …). This is the UCSB analogue of MIT's D019 ``party_simplified`` filter, except
   UCSB has no party proxy, so scoping *is* a name match against the EC-getter set —
   which is why it lives here, downstream of the reconciliation, and not in #36.

**Why UCSB reconcile takes an EC frame and MIT's does not.**
:func:`usvote.mit.reconcile` is a pure string rewrite whose only guard is that every
native name is mapped; its D007 scope was handled upstream (MIT's transform dropped
non-{D,R} rows via D019). UCSB cannot: its columns are the *top* candidates each year,
majors and notable minors alike, and telling a dropped minor from a *forgotten major*
needs the authority on who got electoral votes. So :func:`reconcile_ucsb` takes
``ec_getters`` — the EC ``votes`` fact's president-EV getters — by **dependency
injection** (a frame, never a query, as :func:`~usvote.ucsb.transform.transform_ucsb`
takes ``ec_participation``), and runs the **reciprocal completeness guard**: every
EC-getter that held a popular vote must survive into the reconciled facts. That guard,
not full enumeration of the minors, is what makes dropping-by-omission safe here (see
:func:`_assert_getter_completeness`).

**Curated maps, not a parser (the MIT precedent, D020).** UCSB's ``"LAST"`` / ``"FIRST
M. LAST"`` header spellings are not a mechanical transform of the canonical ``name``:
the same reconciliation drops a middle for some (``ADLAI E. STEVENSON`` → ``Adlai
Stevenson``) and adds one for others (``WENDELL WILLKIE`` → ``Wendell L. Willkie``),
substitutes given names (``BILL CLINTON`` → ``William J. Clinton``), restores an accent
(``JOHN C. FREMONT`` → ``John C. Frémont``), and adds a suffix (``AL GORE`` → ``Albert
Gore Jr.``). No rule covers that, so the map is curated and provenance-carrying,
mirroring the EC correction catalog and ``docs/corrections.md``.

**Keyed on ``(year, ucsb_name)``, not the bare string.** Unlike MIT's 1976-2024 window,
UCSB spans 49 elections in which the same surname denotes different people across years
(the two Roosevelts, the two Adamses, the two Bushes) and one person's UCSB spelling
drifts across years (``HERBERT HOOVER`` in 1928, ``HERBERT C. HOOVER`` in 1932). The
``(year, name)`` key resolves both without ambiguity, and it also *is* the D007 scope
decision made per year: an EC-getter in one year may be a popular-vote-only minor in
another (Van Buren won EVs in 1836, ran Free-Soil with none in 1848).

**Static canonical *values*, not a live join.** Reconcile produces the canonical strings
deterministically (the map *is* the target) and stays pure/offline — no DB, shapefile,
or network; ``ec_getters`` arrives as a frame. The cross-source join against the live
EC dimensions is E6's concern (#69), which still owns the reciprocal *join-side* guard
that every reconciled name is present in the EC ``candidate`` dim. The completeness
guard here is a distinct, **ingest-side, candidate-grain** check: E6 validates the
surviving rows, but a candidate dropped here is gone before E6 sees it, so only a guard
here can catch it.

# whole canonical string; the reconciliations are non-mechanical, which is why this is a

# president candidate, *after* the EC correction pass (usvote.transform) — so the 1944
# footnote marker is already stripped (``Franklin D. Roosevelt``, not ``…*``; via
# strip_name_footnote_markers) and the Table-1/Table-2 reconciliations (Dole, McGovern,
# Trump) are already applied. LHS authority: the distinct named header cells
# usvote.ucsb.parse emits on the real 60-page
# snapshot. Coverage of every LHS is enforced by _assert_native_coverage (a new UCSB
# spelling fails loudly rather than vanishing); the popular-vote-only minors UCSB also
