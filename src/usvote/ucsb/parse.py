"""Parse stage — turn saved UCSB election pages into structured per-year records.

The pure half of the UCSB ingest (E4-S2, #35): it takes HTML already fetched to the
local snapshot by :mod:`usvote.ucsb.scrape` and does no network access, which makes it
fixture-testable offline. Output is a list of :class:`ParsedUCSBYear` records that
E4-S3 (#36) feeds into DataFrames and reconciles against the Electoral College spine.

The whole design rests on one structural finding from the corpus survey
(``docs/ucsb-html-formats.md``): **every data row is ``W = 2 + 3g`` single-colspan
cells** — ``STATE | TOTAL VOTE | (Votes, %, EV) x g``. Only the *header* shape and the
candidate-group count ``g`` vary across eras. So there is exactly one body parser, and
all per-era branching is confined to :func:`detect_layout` and
:func:`parse_candidate_columns`. The invariant worth protecting:
**:func:`parse_state_data_row` never reads ``layout.kind``.**

Six header layouts are modeled — L0 (summary-only, 1789-1820), L1 (stacked 3-row),
L1b (1836: no header colspans at all), L1c (1976: header *narrower* than data rows),
L2 (names-first, nested summary) and L3 (inline 2-row). They are **not chronologically
ordered**: 1936 reverts to L1 mid-L2 block, and 1964/1972/1984/1988 are L2 interleaved
among L3. Branch on detected shape, **never on year** — the one exception being the
year-conditional in :func:`parse_election_year` that decides whether an absent state
table is legitimate (pre-1824) or a regression.

Two conventions this module holds to, both from D024:

- **Absence is never zero.** A candidate not on a state's ballot is ``votes=None``,
  spelled ``--`` (1852+) or a lone U+00A0 (earlier). A literal ``0`` appears nowhere in
  a state-row vote column in the entire corpus, so :func:`validate_year` rejects one.
  Absence is read from the **Votes** cell only — never the percent column, which is
  published pre-rounded and prints ``0.0`` for genuine small counts (1948 California:
  1,228 votes at ``0.0``).
- **Nothing unclassifiable passes silently.** Rows that are not data, totals, a
  legislature status row, or a member of the enumerated benign-skip allowlist raise
  :class:`UCSBParseError`. There is deliberately no ``unknown`` bucket.

Scope note (D024, clarified for #35): the only popular-vote status readable from the
markup is ``legislature_chosen``. ``not_participating`` has **no markup whatsoever** —
the state's row is simply absent — and ``popular_vote`` is the roster's residual, so
both are assigned in #36 against the EC spine. This parser is deliberately
**roster-free**: it emits verbatim cleaned state labels and classifies rows purely
structurally. Label canonicalization is E4-S5's (#38).
