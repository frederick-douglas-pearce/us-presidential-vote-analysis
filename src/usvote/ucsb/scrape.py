"""Scrape stage — snapshot the UCSB per-election popular-vote pages to disk.

The UCSB analogue of the EC :mod:`usvote.scrape` stage, and the only place in this
subpackage where live network access belongs: it saves one raw ``{year}.html`` per
election into a local directory so every downstream stage (parse, transform, load)
runs offline against saved HTML. Ported from the standalone ``_snapshot_ucsb.py``
that produced the existing 60-election snapshot on 2026-07-06 (E4-S1 #34, per D023).

**The politeness contract is the point of this module.** UCSB is a public academic
archive doing us a favor, and the behaviors below are what make re-running this scrape
ethically and operationally safe. They were ported deliberately rather than
reimplemented, because a rewrite loses them *silently* — no test that merely asks "did
we get the HTML" would notice, and the loss stays invisible until the site blocks us,
at which point the damage to our access and to the archive's goodwill is already done:

- **Honors the site's** ``Crawl-delay: 10`` between fetches (see
  :data:`CRAWL_DELAY_SECONDS`).
- **Identifies truthfully** as :data:`USER_AGENT` — matching robots.txt's
  ``User-agent: *``, explicitly *not* ClaudeBot. We are what we say we are.
- **Enumerates year URLs from the already-saved index**, so no page is fetched to
  discover what to fetch (:func:`enumerate_year_urls`).
- **Skips what it already has**, so a re-run costs the server nothing.
- **Halts immediately on 403/429** (:data:`BLOCKED_STATUSES`) — if the server says stop,
  we stop that instant rather than working through the remaining years.
- **Writes a per-year sha256** :data:`MANIFEST_FILENAME` so the snapshot's integrity and
  provenance are checkable after the fact.

Modifying this module means keeping every one of those true.

**The snapshot data never enters this repository** (D022/D023): UCSB grants no reuse
rights and this repo is public, so the directory lives outside the tree, located via
``USVOTE_UCSB_HTML_DIR`` (:mod:`usvote.ucsb.config`). Only this code is versioned —
which is what makes the un-backed-up snapshot re-fetchable rather than irreplaceable.

**Bootstrap (a deliberate limitation).** Enumeration reads an index page that must
already be saved, so this module cannot snapshot into a directory that has no
``_index_elections.html`` — it raises :class:`UCSBScrapeError` rather than fetching the
index itself. That is the original script's behavior, kept on purpose: the index is the
page most likely to have been restructured by the next refresh (2028), and
auto-fetching it would turn "UCSB changed their markup" into a silent green no-op —
*Enumerated 0 election pages*, exit 0 — instead of a human noticing. The one-time manual
step (which carries the same truthful User-Agent) is documented in the ``ConfigError``
and :class:`UCSBScrapeError` messages, where a fresh machine will actually meet it.

**On the fetch seam.** :data:`Fetch` is UCSB-local rather than shared with the EC
scrape's ``Fetch``. The two look similar but encode different knowledge: EC's is "fetch
a URL" (bytes, status discarded); this one is "fetch a URL *under presidency.ucsb.edu's
robots policy*" — it must surface the status code the 403/429 halt reads, and the body
even on an error status. D006's concern is dependency *direction* (a PV source must not
import from the EC spine), which a local seam honors completely.
