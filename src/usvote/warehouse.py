"""Whole-warehouse composition root — build the entire ``dwh`` from every source.

:func:`run_warehouse` sequences the four source/join steps into one runnable build:
the EC spine (:func:`usvote.pipeline.run_ec_pipeline`), the MIT PV source
(:func:`usvote.mit.pipeline.run_mit_pipeline`), optionally the UCSB PV source
(:func:`usvote.ucsb.pipeline.run_ucsb_pipeline`), then the resolved-PV + EC<->PV join
views (:func:`rebuild_views`). It is the programmatic entry point behind
``python -m usvote all`` (#84b).

**This is a composition root, not part of the EC spine.** It lives at the top level
alongside the source-namespaced ``usvote/`` modules, but unlike them it imports *from*
every source (EC + both PV subpackages) to wire them together. That is allowed for the
same reason :mod:`usvote.__main__` is: a composition root sits **above** both EC and
PV, so it is exempt from the D015 source-to-source prohibition exactly as ``__main__``
is (D027). The invariant that keeps the exemption honest is the reverse one — nothing
under ``usvote/{mit,ucsb,pv}/`` may import :mod:`usvote.warehouse` (a back-import would
invert D015 into a cycle); a unit test enforces it.

**Transactions: per-source atomic, not globally atomic (#84a).** ``run_warehouse`` opens
**no** transaction of its own. Each pipeline it calls already wraps its own DB writes in
``with dbc.transaction():`` (the #84a uniform-ownership rule), and
:meth:`DBC.transaction` raises on a nested open, so wrapping the sequence here would be
a bug. The consequence is deliberate: a mid-build failure leaves the already-committed
sources in place and the later ones absent. Recovery is **not** a bare re-run — the
PV/EC loaders are create-if-absent/append, so a bare re-run raises a unique-constraint
violation on the first already-loaded source before it reaches the missing one. The
honest recovery path is ``run_warehouse(..., replace=True)`` (a clean full rebuild).
Scrape/network stays outside every transaction (each pipeline already keeps it out), so
no build holds a transaction open across HTTP.

**``replace`` maps EC-destructive, PV-additive.** ``replace=True`` forwards to
``run_ec_pipeline(replace=True)``, which drops and recreates the ``dwh`` schema — and
because the PV tables and all views live in ``dwh``, that ``DROP SCHEMA ... CASCADE``
takes them with it. So the PV loads run with ``replace=False`` (append onto the *fresh*
schema, the only sane mapping and exactly the integration-test order), and the join
views are **always rebuilt** as the final step — without that rebuild a
``replace=True`` build would leave a warehouse with the fact tables but no
``ec_pv_preferred`` / ``ec_pv_redistributable`` for E7/E8 to read.

**UCSB is gated explicitly, never by environment magic.** ``ucsb_html_dir=None`` (the
default) **skips** UCSB — this function does not consult ``USVOTE_UCSB_HTML_DIR``
itself; the caller decides and passes a directory to include it. This keeps the
D024/D017 principle — missing data is modeled explicitly, never silent — at the
programmatic seam: the returned :class:`WarehouseResult` names exactly which sources
loaded, so a downstream E7 hybrid step can refuse to compute over a warehouse that
silently lacks the UCSB consistency control, and E8 can assert it only ever built over
redistributable data. The ``python -m usvote all`` CLI may auto-detect the snapshot dir,
but only *loudly* (see :mod:`usvote.__main__`). The alignment worth stating: **EC + MIT
are the redistributable public core; UCSB is the analysis-only control** (the D016
split) — so "a fresh public clone builds EC + MIT, UCSB needs the private snapshot" is
not an arbitrary subset.

    Sequences EC -> MIT -> (optional) UCSB -> views on a single ``dbc``:

    1. :func:`usvote.pipeline.run_ec_pipeline` — the EC spine. ``replace`` is
       forwarded here (and here only): ``replace=True`` drops and recreates the ``dwh``
       schema, which cascades away the PV tables and views, so everything downstream
       rebuilds onto a fresh schema.
    2. :func:`usvote.mit.pipeline.run_mit_pipeline` — the MIT PV source, always
       ``replace=False`` (append onto the schema EC just built). ``mit_csv_path=None``
       resolves ``USVOTE_MIT_CSV_PATH`` via ``environ`` inside the MIT pipeline.
    3. :func:`usvote.ucsb.pipeline.run_ucsb_pipeline` — the UCSB PV source, only when
       ``ucsb_html_dir`` is not ``None`` (else UCSB is skipped, explicitly — no env
       magic). Also ``replace=False``.
    4. :func:`rebuild_views` — the resolved-PV + EC<->PV join views, always rebuilt.

    ``years`` scopes every source to the same subset of elections (e.g. ``{2016, 2020}``
    to match the fixtures); ``None`` loads each source's full range. ``environ`` is
    threaded to the two PV pipelines' config resolution (EC takes ``shapefile_path``
    directly). ``fetch`` and ``load_geo`` are the EC stage's offline-injection seams,
    forwarded to :func:`~usvote.pipeline.run_ec_pipeline` untouched (defaults are live
    HTTP + the real shapefile); they let the integration test drive *this* shipped path
    over saved fixtures instead of a hand-wired parallel copy. ``close`` closes ``dbc``
    after the views are built — the orchestrator owns the connection across the whole
    build, so the individual pipelines are called with their default ``close=False``.

    Opens no transaction itself; see the module docstring for the per-source-atomic
    model and why a failed build is recovered with ``replace=True``, not a bare re-run.
