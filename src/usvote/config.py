"""Externalized configuration — read connection + path settings from the environment.

Replaces the notebook's hardcoded config (DB params in Section 4.1, the TIGER
shapefile path in Section 1.3 that had to be hand-edited before every run) so the
pipeline runs on a fresh machine by setting environment variables, not by editing
source (E2-S6, #31).

Two naming conventions, by design:

- **Database** settings use libpq's standard ``PG*`` names (``PGHOST``, ``PGPORT``,
  ``PGDATABASE``, ``PGUSER``, ``PGPASSWORD``). These are the same variables ``psql``,
  ``pg_dump``, and every other Postgres tool already read, so there is a single source
  of truth for "which database" — no parallel ``USVOTE_DB_*`` namespace to drift out of
  sync. We nonetheless read them *explicitly* here (rather than handing psycopg2 an
  empty dict and letting libpq read the ambient environment) so the resolution is
  deterministic, the defaults are ours, and tests can drive it through an injected
  ``environ`` dict. The DB is shared across all data sources, so this getter stays
  source-agnostic in the top-level package; the coming ``usvote/ucsb`` / ``usvote/mit``
  subpackages import it rather than re-implementing it.
- **App-specific** inputs use a ``USVOTE_*`` prefix (``USVOTE_SHAPEFILE_PATH``). Future
  per-source inputs follow the same shape (e.g. ``USVOTE_MIT_CSV_PATH``) and live in the
  relevant subpackage's own config module.

No dotenv dependency: read ``os.environ`` directly. To load a local ``.env``
(git-ignored), source it into the shell first — see the README's Configuration
section.
