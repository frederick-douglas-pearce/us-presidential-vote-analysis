"""Read stage — load the MIT Election Lab president CSV into a DataFrame.

The ingest seam of the MIT pipeline, and the MIT analogue of the EC
:mod:`usvote.scrape` stage. It is deliberately **not** named ``scrape.py``: MIT
ships a single clean local CSV already at the (year, state, candidate) fact grain
(4,822 rows, 13 elections 1976–2024, 51 jurisdictions; CC0 — see D016 and
``.claude/specs/research-pv-source.md`` §4), so there is no network access and no
snapshot/replay story. Naming it ``read.py`` keeps the EC ``scrape.py`` "only place
network belongs" contract intact while marking this as its own kind of ingest.

The load is a pure local-file read: point it at a path (or let it resolve
``USVOTE_MIT_CSV_PATH`` via :mod:`usvote.mit.config`) and it returns the raw frame.
It intentionally does **no** transform work — no filtering to EC-getting candidates,
no melting, no name reconciliation, no NaN handling; those belong to the later MIT
transform stage. The one guard it does apply is a **schema check**: the CSV's
columns must contain every name in :data:`EXPECTED_COLUMNS`, so an upstream MIT
re-release that renames or drops a column fails loudly here rather than surfacing as
a confusing ``KeyError`` deep in transform. The check is a *subset* test — MIT
versions the file and may add columns; additive changes are non-breaking.
