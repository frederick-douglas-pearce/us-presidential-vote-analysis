"""Transform & validate stage — MIT raw CSV -> the shared PV record shape.

The MIT analogue of the EC :mod:`usvote.transform` stage, and the second half of
the MIT pipeline after :mod:`usvote.mit.read`. It maps the raw MIT
``1976-2024-president.csv`` frame onto the **shared PV record shape** fixed by
decision **D018** — one long-format row per ``(source, year, state, candidate)`` —
so MIT and (later) UCSB rows are interchangeable at load.

The transform is a pure function (:func:`transform_mit`); it does column selection,
typing, the D007 candidate-scope filter, fusion-line aggregation, provenance
tagging, and a set of load-bearing validations. It deliberately does **not**:

- reconcile ``state``/``candidate`` onto the EC canonical keys — that is #67; the
  frame here carries MIT-native names (D018);
- load, assign a surrogate key, or add FKs — that is #66 (D018);
- store a ``redistributable`` column — that is a per-*source* attribute of the
  ``pv_source`` reference table, derived by join (D017/D018);
- convert NaN -> None — that is owned once at the DB write boundary
  (``usvote.db.insert_df_into_table``), never via an upstream ``.map`` (which
  silently no-ops on ``StringDtype``).

**Order is load-bearing.** Two orderings matter and are enforced by tests:

1. **Reconcile totals *before* filtering.** ``sum(candidatevotes) == totalvotes``
   per ``(year, state)`` is a read/parse regression guard that only holds on the
   *complete* candidate set, so it must run before any row is dropped.
2. **Aggregate fusion lines *before* the D007 filter.** In fusion-voting states MIT
   lists a candidate on multiple party lines as separate rows, coding the secondary
   lines under their minor party (``party_simplified == "OTHER"`` — e.g. Clinton's
   2016 NY Working Families / Women's Equality lines). Filtering to
   ``{DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN}`` *first* would drop those ``OTHER`` lines and then sum
   only the main line — a silent undercount of a major candidate (the exact
   ``pv_preferred`` ``DISTINCT ON`` hazard D018 warns about). So we aggregate to the
   ``(year, state, candidate)`` grain first, take the plurality line's party, and
   only then apply the party filter.

Ported for #65 (E5-S2); mirrors the EC transform's conventions: a typed
:class:`MITTransformError`, provenance-carrying module constants for the historical
special-cases, named-column ops (no positional ``.iloc``), and dense inline
assertions rewritten as real, tested validation functions.

#: The shared PV record-shape columns, in load order (D018). Both PV sources emit

# --- D007 candidate scope (D019) -------------------------------------------
#: The MIT D007 candidate-scope proxy (D019): across 1976-2024 *every* electoral
#: vote went to a Democratic or Republican nominee, so ``party_simplified`` in this
#: set is an effectively-exact, zero-maintenance stand-in for "received electoral
#: votes." Libertarian/Green PV candidates (0 EC votes in the window) are knowingly

#: 2,535 and New York under-counts by 874 relative to the reported ``totalvotes``
#: (write-in aggregation quirks in MIT's 2024 file). Encoding the *exact* expected
#: diff means the pre-filter guard still fires if a future MIT re-release changes
#: these numbers or introduces a new mismatch, mirroring the EC correction pattern.

    groupby key the fusion aggregation would drop silently, so we drop it explicitly.

    We deliberately do **not** filter on the ``writein`` flag. The D007 scope is
    enforced by the ``{DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN}`` party filter (D019), which already
    subsumes the write-in long tail (it is all ``OTHER``); filtering on ``writein``
