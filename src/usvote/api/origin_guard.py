"""Origin lock-down for the public deployment (E8-S7, #101 / D034).

When the deployed API is fronted by Cloudflare (D034), a bot could bypass the edge
rate-limits + WAF by hitting the raw Cloud Run ``run.app`` URL directly. To close that,
a Cloudflare Transform Rule injects a shared secret header on every proxied request, and
this guard **rejects any ``/v1`` request that lacks it** (403).

Enforcement is **opt-in and fail-open** (the architect-reviewed default): it activates
only when :data:`usvote.api.config.ORIGIN_SECRET_VAR` is set
(:attr:`ApiSettings.origin_secret`). Unset — local dev, the unit suite, the D033
container smoke test — means no enforcement, so those paths are unaffected. The
fail-open default is made **observable** rather than silent (a ``/health`` field + a
one-line startup log) so a dropped Secret-Manager binding in production is visible, and
a post-deploy check asserts the raw origin 403s.

``/health`` (and everything outside the ``/v1`` prefix) is **always exempt**: Cloud
Run's own startup/liveness probes and the D033 smoke test do not traverse Cloudflare, so
they never carry the secret.

Stdlib-only (:mod:`hmac`) + starlette — nothing new crosses the D028 ``usvote/api/``
import boundary (guarded by ``tests/unit/test_api_import_graph.py``).
