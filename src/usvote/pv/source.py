"""The ``pv_source`` reference table — the SSOT for per-source PV attributes (D017).

The union of the two PV sources keeps **both** rows for every overlapping
``(year, state, candidate)`` (D017 §1, encoded in :mod:`usvote.pv.schema` by putting
``source`` in the natural key). Which source *wins* where both exist, whether a source
may be redistributed, and under what license are **per-source** attributes — one fact
per source, not per fact row — so they live in a tiny reference table keyed on
``source``, not as columns on ``dwh.pv_votes``. Storing them here (data, not code) is
what keeps D017's forward-compat guarantee literally true: a UCSB redistribution grant,
or adding a third source, is a **one-row edit** with no view or DDL change.

This module is also the home of the two **source-name literals** ``SOURCE_MIT`` /
``SOURCE_UCSB``. They were defined inside ``usvote.mit.transform`` / ``usvote.ucsb.
transform``; they move here so ``usvote.pv`` (which must key ``pv_source`` and the
resolution views on them) can name them without importing a source subpackage — that
would invert the D006 ``source -> pv`` dependency. Both transforms now import them from
here (the allowed direction), so the string ``"UCSB"`` has exactly one definition.

Consumed by :mod:`usvote.pv.views` (``precedence_rank`` drives ``pv_preferred``'s
``DISTINCT ON``; ``redistributable`` defines ``pv_redistributable``) and loaded by
:func:`usvote.pv.load.load_pv_source`.
