"""Load stage — write the shared-shape PV frames into their ``dwh`` tables.

The source-neutral PV analogue of the EC :func:`usvote.load.load_dataframes`. Every
PV source (MIT #66, later UCSB #37) loads through this one seam: hand it a frame on
the D018 shared shape (:data:`usvote.pv.schema.SHARED_PV_COLUMNS`, already reconciled
onto the canonical keys) and it assigns the surrogate ``pv_id``, creates the shared
table if absent, and inserts — tagged by whatever ``source`` value the frame carries.

Two per-source loaders write the raw facts, deliberately parallel:
:func:`load_pv_records` writes the ``dwh.pv_votes`` fact, and :func:`load_pv_status`
writes the D024 ``dwh.pv_state_status`` roster (the second frame a source's transform
emits). Both are source-neutral — UCSB (#37) is the first caller of the roster loader,
but E6's MIT roster backfill is the second, so neither can live under a source
subpackage. A source that loads both (UCSB) applies **one** ``replace`` flag to both
calls. These loaders do not open a transaction themselves — atomicity is the *caller's*
to own: :func:`usvote.ucsb.pipeline.run_ucsb_pipeline` wraps both writes in a single
:meth:`usvote.db.DBC.transaction` (#84a), so the roster/fact pair is written
all-or-nothing and the D024 two-way invariant can never be left half-written in the DB.

The union story (#68, D017) adds three more seams here, over the *already-loaded*
per-source facts rather than writing a new one: :func:`load_pv_source` seeds the small
``dwh.pv_source`` reference table, :func:`create_pv_views` creates the three resolution
views (``pv_preferred``/``pv_redistributable``/``pv_ucsb``), and :func:`build_pv_union`
orchestrates the two. There is no fourth "union" fact write — the raw union *is*
``dwh.pv_votes`` (both sources stacked, tagged by ``source``, overlap kept per D017 §1);
the views resolve the series at read time. See :mod:`usvote.pv.views` for why joining
the raw union downstream (#69) would double-count the overlap.

**Two invariants this module exists to protect:**

- **Never a schema-level ``replace``.** The EC loader's ``replace=True`` cascades a
  drop of the *entire* ``dwh`` schema (``create_schema(replace=True)`` ->
  ``DROP SCHEMA ... CASCADE``). The PV table shares ``dwh`` with the EC spine, so
  doing that here would wipe ``state``/``candidate``/``votes`` on every PV reload.
  :func:`load_pv_records` therefore calls ``create_schema(replace=False)``
  *unconditionally* and gates ``replace`` only at the **table** level — a PV reload
  drops at most ``dwh.pv_votes``, never the schema. A unit test asserts no
  schema-level drop is ever issued.
- **The database owns the surrogate key; the DB boundary owns NaN -> None.**
  ``pv_id`` is a ``GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY`` column (see
  :func:`usvote.pv.schema.build_pv_column_defs`), so Postgres assigns it from a
  persistent sequence on insert and the loader **never supplies it**. This is the fix
  for the multi-source-coexistence hazard: a per-call pandas ``range(1, n+1)`` would
  restart at 1 on every load and collide on the ``pv_id`` PK the moment a second
  source (UCSB #37) or a second year-batch is appended — the exact "keep both rows"
  case D017 requires. Deferring the id to the DB sequence keeps ids unique across all
  loads. (The EC ``votes`` fact assigns ``votes_id`` in pandas instead, but EC always
  rebuilds the whole schema in one shot, so it never appends; PV is append-shaped.)
  NaN/NA -> SQL NULL and numpy unboxing stay owned by
  ``usvote.db.insert_df_into_table`` — this module adds no upstream ``.map`` pass
  (which would silently no-op on ``StringDtype``; CLAUDE.md).

    - the frame is shape/grain-guarded (:func:`assert_roster_shape`,

    always runs after the EC spine (its ``state`` FK needs ``dwh.state``, and the

    by the time this is called), so ``dwh`` provably exists and re-issuing
