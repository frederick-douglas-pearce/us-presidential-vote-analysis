"""Publish posts from this repo's posts/ to the Jekyll Pages site.

Transforms each post's frontmatter to Pages conventions and copies its OG card.

Ported from the `claude-code-sessions` repo (issue #132), which runs the same
publishing pattern into the same Pages site. Separation of concerns, preserved
from the source: the Action (`.github/workflows/pages-sync.yml`) owns auth and
the reconcile-retry push; this script owns the transform, OG-image resolution,
and the content-compare that makes re-runs idempotent.

Usage:
    publish-to-pages.py <source.md>... --posts-dir DIR --assets-dir DIR [--dry-run]

Example:
    python3 tooling/publish-to-pages.py \\
        posts/2026-08-06-222-votes-away.md \\
        --posts-dir  /path/to/frederick-douglas-pearce.github.io/_posts/ \\
        --assets-dir /path/to/frederick-douglas-pearce.github.io/assets/img/

What it does, per post:

1. **Transform frontmatter.** Strip the upstream-only field (`og_card_source`);
   copy the body and every other field byte-for-byte. The strip is line-level,
   not a YAML round-trip, so the source formatting survives unchanged. (This
   repo has no Prettier gate, unlike the source repo — the line-level approach
   is kept anyway, because a round-trip would reflow the frontmatter for no
   benefit.)
2. **Resolve + copy the OG card**: the post's `og_card_source` field
   (repo-root-relative) is the source; the target is `<assets-dir>/<basename of
   the post's og_image URL>`.

Resolution is **fail-closed, never a glob**: a missing field, an absolute or
repo-escaping path, a missing source file, or two posts colliding on one target
all abort the run with zero writes. A wrong image shipped under a green Action
is the exact failure mode this design exists to prevent.

Idempotency is **content-compare, not push-diff**: every output is written only
when its bytes differ from what's already in the Pages tree, so a re-run makes
no spurious changes and the Action makes no empty commit.

Atomicity is **validate-all-then-write**: the full plan for ALL posts is built
and validated (Phase 1) before a single byte is written (Phase 2), so one bad
post can't half-publish the batch. Phase 2 is not filesystem-transactional — a
mid-batch failure (e.g. disk full) can leave a partial tree — but the next run's
content-compare plus the Action's reconcile-retry self-heal it, and the
realistic failure (a missing card) is caught in Phase 1 before any write.

**Shared Pages namespace.** This site also receives posts from
`claude-code-sessions`. The collision check below sees only *this* repo's posts,
so two posts from different source repos whose `og_image` basenames matched
would overwrite each other silently. Detecting that would need provenance the
publisher does not have; the mitigation is an operator rule — keep the slug
distinct across the two series (see posts/README.md).
