"""Publish posts from this repo's posts/ to the Jekyll Pages site.

Transforms each post's frontmatter to Pages conventions and copies its OG card.

Ported from the `claude-code-sessions` repo (issue #132), which runs the same
publishing pattern into the same Pages site. Separation of concerns, preserved
from the source: the Action (`.github/workflows/pages-sync.yml`) owns auth and
the reconcile-retry push; this script owns the transform, OG-image resolution,
and the content-compare that makes re-runs idempotent.

Usage:
    publish-to-pages.py <source.md>... --posts-dir DIR --assets-dir DIR
                        --source-repo SLUG [--dry-run]

Example:
    python3 tooling/publish-to-pages.py \\
        posts/2026-08-06-222-votes-away.md \\
        --posts-dir  /path/to/frederick-douglas-pearce.github.io/_posts/ \\
        --assets-dir /path/to/frederick-douglas-pearce.github.io/assets/img/ \\
        --source-repo us-presidential-vote-analysis

`--source-repo` is this repo's GitHub slug, and it is REQUIRED: it is the
identity the shared-namespace guard below compares against. Note it is the
HYPHENATED slug — the working directory is `us_presidential_vote_analysis`,
so it is not the directory name. The Action passes
`${{ github.event.repository.name }}`, which is the same value it builds the
sync commit subject from.

What it does, per post:

1. **Transform frontmatter.** Strip the upstream-only field (`og_card_source`);
   copy the body and every other field byte-for-byte. The strip is line-level,
   not a YAML round-trip, so the source formatting survives unchanged (a
   round-trip would reflow the frontmatter for no benefit).

   Because the body is copied verbatim, THIS SCRIPT NEVER FORMATS ANYTHING —
   what a post says here is what lands on the site, and the site runs
   `prettier . --check` on every push to its main. Keeping the posts in the
   site's dialect is therefore a pre-merge gate's job, not this script's:
   `.github/workflows/prettier.yml`, pinned to the site's exact formatter
   versions. Do not "helpfully" add a format pass here — it would break the
   byte-for-byte contract and make the published post differ from the source of
   record. (The gate was missing when this was ported in #132, and post 1 duly
   turned the site red on 2026-08-12; see posts/README.md.)
2. **Resolve + copy the OG card**: the post's `og_card_source` field
   (repo-root-relative) is the source; the target is `<assets-dir>/<basename of
   the post's og_image URL>`.

Resolution is **fail-closed, never a glob**: a missing field, an absolute or
repo-escaping path, a missing source file, or two posts colliding on one target
all abort the run with zero writes. A wrong image shipped under a green Action
is the exact failure mode this design exists to prevent.

Idempotency is **content-compare, not push-diff**: every output is written only
when its bytes differ from what's already in the Pages tree, so a re-run makes
no spurious changes and the Action makes no empty commit.

Atomicity is **validate-all-then-write**: the full plan for ALL posts is built
and validated (Phase 1) before a single byte is written (Phase 2), so one bad
post can't half-publish the batch. Phase 2 is not filesystem-transactional — a
mid-batch failure (e.g. disk full) can leave a partial tree — but the next run's
content-compare plus the Action's reconcile-retry self-heal it, and the
realistic failure (a missing card) is caught in Phase 1 before any write.

**Shared Pages namespace.** This site also receives posts from
`claude-code-sessions`. `build_plan`'s collision check sees only *this* repo's
posts, so a cross-repo collision never enters either publisher's plan. That gap
is closed by `assert_no_foreign_overwrite`, a SECOND Phase-1 validator: before
any write, a target that already exists with different bytes must have been
written last by a sync from THIS repo, or the run aborts. The provenance is the
Pages repo's own history — each sync commits as
`chore(sync): publish posts from <repo>@<sha>`, under the author
`pages-sync[bot]`. **Both halves are read** (#200/D058): the subject says which
publisher, and the author says that some publisher synced this at all, so a
sibling that rewords its subject is refused rather than walked past. That
history has to be there:
the Action's `fetch-depth: 0` predates this guard (it exists for the
reconcile-retry loop) but the guard now depends on it too, and the workflow
says so at the checkout step. A shallow clone does not merely degrade this — it
**silently fails open**: the grafted tip is parentless, so every path reads as
added there and every target resolves to whoever the tip's sync names. Right
after any of our own publishes that is *us*, so the sibling's cards would be
overwritten with no refusal at all — the exact bug this guard exists to fix.

One consequence is load-bearing rather than incidental: the check is invisible
to the PR guard (`tooling/check-og-cards.py`), which has no Pages checkout. A
slug colliding with `claude-code-sessions` passes CI green and fails at publish
time — loudly, but late. See posts/README.md.

It is also **one-sided until the sibling repo ports it**: this repo will refuse
to overwrite a card `claude-code-sessions` owns, but not the reverse. The
operator rule — keep the slug distinct across the two series — is therefore
still worth following, not superseded (see posts/README.md).

#: Every sync into the shared Pages repo commits under this subject, naming its
#: source repo — the provenance the guard needs, recorded by the very mechanism
#: that would be racing. Our Action builds it from the same value it passes to
#: `--source-repo` (see .github/workflows/pages-sync.yml), so OUR half cannot
#: drift.
#:
#: The sibling's half is still an assumption, not an invariant: it must match
#: what `claude-code-sessions`'s own Action writes, which no test here can pin.
#: Verified by hand against that repo's `pages-sync.yml` on 2026-08-28, and
#: against its 15 sync commits in the live Pages history on 2026-09-07 —
#: `chore(sync): publish posts from claude-code-sessions@<sha>`, identical.
#:
#: **Drift in that subject no longer fails open**, which is the change #200 made
#: and the reason this comment is shorter than it was. A drifted sibling subject
#: was previously not read as "theirs" — it was not read at all, so the scan
#: walked past it to an older sync of OURS and the overwrite proceeded silently.
#: `_SYNC_AUTHOR` below is the second, independent signal that closes that: the
#: commit is still authored by the sync bot, so it is now read as an
#: unattributable sync and refused. See D058, which supersedes D056's accepted
#: residual on this point (D056 itself is unedited — append-only).
_SYNC_SUBJECT = re.compile(
    r"^chore\(sync\): publish posts from (?P<repo>[A-Za-z0-9._-]+)@"
)

#: The identity BOTH publishers' syncs commit under — the second signal, and the
#: only thing standing between a reworded sibling subject and a silent
#: overwrite. Our own Action sets it (`git config user.name` in
#: .github/workflows/pages-sync.yml, tied to this constant by
#: `test_the_workflow_commits_under_the_identity_the_guard_keys_on`); the
#: sibling's is verified empirically rather than assumed — all 23 sync commits
#: in the live Pages history, ours and theirs alike, carry it (2026-09-07).
#:
#: Deliberately the sync identity and NOT "any bot": the Pages repo's other
#: automated writer is `dependabot[bot]`, and a rule keyed on the `[bot]` suffix
#: would refuse the day it — or any future image optimizer — touched a guarded
#: dir. Narrow makes that safety structural rather than contingent on what
#: dependabot happens to write today. See D058.
_SYNC_AUTHOR = "pages-sync[bot]"

#: The `git log` format the provenance walk reads — and the one place its field
#: order is decided.
#:
#: **The free-text field goes LAST, and that is a security property, not a style
#: choice.** Python's `str.splitlines()` splits on boundaries git's `%s` does not
#: fold — `\v`, `\f`, `\r`, `\x1c`-`\x1e`, `\x85`, U+2028, U+2029 — so one commit
#: subject can arrive as several Python "lines". Because `%an` is emitted first,
#: every fragment after such a boundary IN THE SUBJECT — the attacker-controlled
#: field, and the case this guards — lands on a line carrying no NUL:
#: `partition("\x00")` puts it in the AUTHOR slot and leaves `subject == ""`,
#: which can never parse as a sync. (The fragment BEFORE the first boundary
#: keeps the NUL-bearing line and so keeps a real subject slot — harmless, since
#: an attacker who can put a valid sync at the HEAD of a subject has no need of
#: a separator at all.) Reorder this to `%s%x00%an` and a subject
#: crafted as `typo fix<U+2028>chore(sync): publish posts from <us>@<sha>` splits
#: into a fragment that parses as OURS — granting an overwrite of the sibling's
#: file, silently, under a green Action.
#:
#: **The separator is NUL** because an author name cannot contain one, so the
#: first `\x00` on a line is unambiguously the field boundary; and `%s` is
#: single-line as far as git is concerned, so one commit stays one git line.
#:
#: Both halves are pinned by `test_the_provenance_format_puts_the_free_text_field_last`,
#: and the security consequence by
#: `test_a_split_forging_subject_cannot_forge_our_ownership` — both in
#: `tests/unit/test_publish_to_pages.py`. Until #215 this order was held by a
#: comment alone, which is the defect class this repo refuses to leave standing.

    `UNATTRIBUTED_SYNC` means the most recent commit this reader could attribute
    to a publisher at all was one it could not attribute to WHICH publisher: a
    commit authored by `_SYNC_AUTHOR` whose subject `_SYNC_SUBJECT` does not
    parse. That is the sibling-drift case (#200/D058), and reading it required a
    second signal because the subject alone cannot: a drifted subject is
    indistinguishable from prose, so it was previously skipped and the scan
    resolved ownership to whatever it found NEXT — an older sync of ours,
    typically, which meant the overwrite proceeded. The author survives the walk
    where the subject does not.

    **Author (%an), not committer.** They are equal for a direct-push sync in
    both repos today, but the author is what survives a rebase or cherry-pick of
    a sync commit, where the committer flips to whoever rewrote it — and "who
    originally published this target" is the provenance question being asked.
    Guarded since #223 by `test_a_rebased_sibling_sync_is_not_misread_as_ours`,
    which builds a history where the two differ, and by
    `test_the_provenance_format_reads_the_author_not_the_committer` on the
    constant. Until then this paragraph was the only thing holding it: swapping
    `_PROVENANCE_FORMAT` to `%cn` left all 55 tests in
    `tests/unit/test_publish_to_pages.py` green — and the whole unit suite with
    them — while restoring the D058 silent overwrite.

    **Scoped to `dest`, by the `-- <path>` pathspec on the log call.** The
    summary line above says *touching `dest`*; this is the mechanism that makes
    it true, and it is load-bearing rather than incidental. Drop the pathspec and
    the walk answers "who wrote the repo last" instead of "who wrote this target
    last": whichever publisher synced most recently then owns EVERY target, and
    right after one of our own publishes that is us, so the D058 overwrite
    proceeds. Measured, and green across the whole unit suite until #225 — see
    `test_a_sibling_owned_target_is_not_read_from_our_sync_of_another_file`,
    the first fixture here holding two targets owned by two publishers.

    **A RENAME is not covered by that, and is not fail-closed in general.** A
    path-scoped walk loses everything BEFORE a rename but keeps the renaming
    commit. A rename made by hand is a non-sync writer, so
    this returns None and the caller refuses; a rename made INSIDE a sync commit
    is attributed to that sync — ours included, which permits the write.
    `--follow` is not used, and would not rescue the second case anyway: the loop
    below returns on the newest parseable sync subject, which IS the renaming
    commit, so nothing `--follow` adds behind it is ever reached.

    **The most recent SYNC commit, not the most recent commit.** Reading the
    latest commit of any kind would let one ordinary edit on the Pages side —
    a typo fixed in place, or a bulk `prettier --write` of the kind that follows
    the site going red (twice so far — see .github/workflows/prettier.yml) —
    permanently reclassify our own post as foreign. Since the Action re-publishes every
    dated post on every run and aborts the whole batch on the first refusal,
    that would block *all* future publishing, on every retry, until someone
    hand-edited the Pages repo. Skipping non-sync commits keeps the question
    the one that matters: which publisher put this target here?

    Overwriting a later hand edit to one of OUR posts is correct, and is the
    contract that already held: this repo's `posts/` is the source of record,
    and every run rewrites its own targets from it.

    Runs `git -C <dest's own dir>`, letting git find the repo by its own upward
    walk. **That walk is not bounded here.** An earlier attempt compared the
    discovered toplevel against `dest`, which is a tautology: git found that
    repo BY walking up from `dest`, so it is always an ancestor. A bound from
    one target alone would need a different question entirely (`git ls-files
    --error-unmatch`, say); it is not attempted, rather than impossible.
    What `run()` rules out instead is narrower and decidable without git — the
    Pages dirs may not sit inside `REPO_ROOT`.

    So a Pages tree that is not a checkout, sitting under some unrelated third
    repository, consults that repository's history. That *usually* refuses, for
    want of any `chore(sync)` commit — but not always: a history that happens to
    carry our own sync subject at that path grants ownership instead, which is
    what the probe behind this rewrite actually observed. It is out of reach of
    CI, where the Action checks source and Pages out as siblings.

    Deliberately checks BOTH target kinds. The card is the likelier collision —
    a shared slug like `token-accounting-og.png` is plausible across two
