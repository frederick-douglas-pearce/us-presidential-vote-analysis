"""Publish posts from this repo's posts/ to the Jekyll Pages site.

Transforms each post's frontmatter to Pages conventions and copies its OG card.

Ported from the `claude-code-sessions` repo (issue #132), which runs the same
publishing pattern into the same Pages site. Separation of concerns, preserved
from the source: the Action (`.github/workflows/pages-sync.yml`) owns auth and
the reconcile-retry push; this script owns the transform, OG-image resolution,
and the content-compare that makes re-runs idempotent.

Usage:
    publish-to-pages.py <source.md>... --posts-dir DIR --assets-dir DIR
                        --source-repo SLUG [--dry-run]

Example:
    python3 tooling/publish-to-pages.py \\
        posts/2026-08-06-222-votes-away.md \\
        --posts-dir  /path/to/frederick-douglas-pearce.github.io/_posts/ \\
        --assets-dir /path/to/frederick-douglas-pearce.github.io/assets/img/ \\
        --source-repo us-presidential-vote-analysis

`--source-repo` is this repo's GitHub slug, and it is REQUIRED: it is the
identity the shared-namespace guard below compares against. Note it is the
HYPHENATED slug, which is not derivable from the local checkout — the working
directory is `us_presidential_vote_analysis`. The Action passes
`${{ github.event.repository.name }}`, which is the same value it builds the
sync commit subject from.

What it does, per post:

1. **Transform frontmatter.** Strip the upstream-only field (`og_card_source`);
   copy the body and every other field byte-for-byte. The strip is line-level,
   not a YAML round-trip, so the source formatting survives unchanged (a
   round-trip would reflow the frontmatter for no benefit).

   Because the body is copied verbatim, THIS SCRIPT NEVER FORMATS ANYTHING —
   what a post says here is what lands on the site, and the site runs
   `prettier . --check` on every push to its main. Keeping the posts in the
   site's dialect is therefore a pre-merge gate's job, not this script's:
   `.github/workflows/prettier.yml`, pinned to the site's exact formatter
   versions. Do not "helpfully" add a format pass here — it would break the
   byte-for-byte contract and make the published post differ from the source of
   record. (The gate was missing when this was ported in #132, and post 1 duly
   turned the site red on 2026-08-12; see posts/README.md.)
2. **Resolve + copy the OG card**: the post's `og_card_source` field
   (repo-root-relative) is the source; the target is `<assets-dir>/<basename of
   the post's og_image URL>`.

Resolution is **fail-closed, never a glob**: a missing field, an absolute or
repo-escaping path, a missing source file, or two posts colliding on one target
all abort the run with zero writes. A wrong image shipped under a green Action
is the exact failure mode this design exists to prevent.

Idempotency is **content-compare, not push-diff**: every output is written only
when its bytes differ from what's already in the Pages tree, so a re-run makes
no spurious changes and the Action makes no empty commit.

Atomicity is **validate-all-then-write**: the full plan for ALL posts is built
and validated (Phase 1) before a single byte is written (Phase 2), so one bad
post can't half-publish the batch. Phase 2 is not filesystem-transactional — a
mid-batch failure (e.g. disk full) can leave a partial tree — but the next run's
content-compare plus the Action's reconcile-retry self-heal it, and the
realistic failure (a missing card) is caught in Phase 1 before any write.

**Shared Pages namespace.** This site also receives posts from
`claude-code-sessions`. `build_plan`'s collision check sees only *this* repo's
posts, so a cross-repo collision never enters either publisher's plan. That gap
is closed by `assert_no_foreign_overwrite`, a SECOND Phase-1 validator: before
any write, a target that already exists with different bytes must have been
written last by a sync from THIS repo, or the run aborts. The provenance is the
Pages repo's own history — each sync commits as
`chore(sync): publish posts from <repo>@<sha>`. That history has to be there:
the Action's `fetch-depth: 0` predates this guard (it exists for the
reconcile-retry loop) but the guard now depends on it too, and the workflow
says so at the checkout step — a shallow clone would return no history for
every pre-tip target and refuse every update.

One consequence is load-bearing rather than incidental: the check is invisible
to the PR guard (`tooling/check-og-cards.py`), which has no Pages checkout. A
slug colliding with `claude-code-sessions` passes CI green and fails at publish
time — loudly, but late. See posts/README.md.

It is also **one-sided until the sibling repo ports it**: this repo will refuse
to overwrite a card `claude-code-sessions` owns, but not the reverse. The
operator rule — keep the slug distinct across the two series — is therefore
still worth following, not superseded (see posts/README.md).
