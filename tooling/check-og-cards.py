"""Pre-merge guard: every post under posts/ has a resolvable OG card.

The Pages-sync Action (`.github/workflows/pages-sync.yml` →
`tooling/publish-to-pages.py`) resolves each post's `og_card_source`, copies the
rendered card into the Pages repo, and **fails closed** if it can't. But that
only runs at publish time — on a push to `main` — so a post merged without its
(manually rendered) OG card turns the sync red on `main`, after the fact. That is
not hypothetical: it happened in the `claude-code-sessions` repo for its Part 3
post, which is why this guard exists to be ported alongside the publisher.

This guard runs the publisher's OWN Phase-1 validator (`build_plan`) on PRs, so
the same fail-closed conditions — missing/empty `og_card_source`, an absolute or
repo-escaping path, a missing source file, a missing `og_image`, and cross-post
image-target collisions — surface on the PR instead of on `main`. By reusing
`build_plan` rather than re-deriving the rules, the guard cannot drift from what
`build_plan` enforces; a future fail-closed condition added THERE is inherited
for free.

**It does not cover everything publish enforces, and the gap is deliberate.**
`publish-to-pages.py` runs a second Phase-1 validator outside `build_plan` —
`assert_no_foreign_overwrite`, the shared-namespace guard (#157) — which needs
the Pages repo's commit history to decide whether a target belongs to this repo
or to `claude-code-sessions`. This guard has no Pages checkout by design (see
below), so it structurally cannot run that check: a slug that collides with the
sibling publisher passes here green and stops at the sync. That is recorded in
posts/README.md, where an author writing a slug will meet it.

Unlike the source repo (where `posts/` is direct-commit-allowed to `main`, making
its guard advisory), this repo is PR-per-feature-branch, so the guard is a real
pre-merge gate.

It guards card *presence*, not *generation*: rendering stays the deliberate local
step (`uv run python tooling/render-og-card.py <brief>.toml`, which needs
Inkscape). Stdlib only; needs no Pages repo, checkout, or PAT — `build_plan` is
Phase 1 (no writes), so the Pages target dirs are passed as inert placeholders
used only as plan keys.

Usage:
    python3 tooling/check-og-cards.py [posts/NNNN-*.md ...]

Defaults to every dated post (`posts/[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-*.md`), matching the
publisher's own selection so the two see the same file set (and the guard skips
`posts/README.md`). Exit 0 if all resolve, 1 with a per-post report otherwise.
