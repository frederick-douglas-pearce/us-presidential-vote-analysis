"""Shared, non-fixture test helpers.

Plain helpers (fake connections, ``DBC`` builders, the state-name set, the
fixtures-dir path) live here rather than in ``conftest.py`` so tests at any
depth — ``tests/unit/`` and ``tests/integration/`` alike — can import them via
a stable absolute path (``from tests._helpers import ...``) without importing
from a conftest module (a pytest anti-pattern). ``conftest.py`` is reserved for
fixtures, which pytest discovers automatically.

The recording fake connection lets unit tests assert on the SQL strings ``DBC``
builds without a live Postgres; the EC and future ``usvote/ucsb`` /
``usvote/mit`` load stages all construct a ``DBC`` and will want the same seam.
