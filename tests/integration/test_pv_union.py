"""Live-Postgres integration tests for the #68 PV union (``usvote.pv`` D017 views).

Excluded from the default suite by the ``integration`` marker; run with
``pytest -m integration`` against a real database. Two tests, split deliberately by what
each needs:

- **``test_union_views_resolve_a_synthetic_overlap``** — the crux, and **not** gated on
  the UCSB corpus. It seeds the EC spine (for the ``pv_votes.state`` FK), then loads a
  small **fabricated** two-source union straight into ``dwh.pv_votes`` — an overlap key
  (MIT + UCSB), a pre-1976 key (UCSB only), and a modern MIT-only key — and asserts the
  live views resolve exactly as D017 requires. The rows are invented (D022 forbids real
  UCSB *bytes*, not the string ``'UCSB'``), so the precedence-resolution and
  public-surface leak-guard checks run against real Postgres with only a database
  available. The pure ``resolve_preferred`` oracle proves the same resolution offline in
  ``tests/unit/test_pv_views.py``; this confirms the emitted SQL agrees with it.

- **``test_union_over_a_real_two_source_load``** — the end-to-end check, doubly gated
  (``integration`` + ``USVOTE_UCSB_HTML_DIR``): it runs the real MIT and UCSB pipelines
  for 2016+2020 and asserts the overlap resolves to MIT and no UCSB row reaches
  ``pv_redistributable``, over genuinely reconciled data.

Config + skip-if-unset come from the shared ``integration_db_config`` fixture.
