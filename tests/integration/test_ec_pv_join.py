"""Live-Postgres integration tests for the EC-left EC<->PV join (#69 / D026).

Excluded from the default suite by the ``integration`` marker; run with
``pytest -m integration`` against a real database. The join uses a window SUM and a
LEFT JOIN over a resolved view, so the live view is where the emitted SQL is proven to
behave like the pure oracle in ``tests/unit/test_join.py``.

Two tests, split by what each needs:

- **``test_join_resolves_a_synthetic_participant_set``** — the crux, **not** gated on the
  UCSB corpus. It seeds the real EC spine for 2016+2020, then loads a small **fabricated**
  PV union that reuses **real** canonical candidate/state names (so the D026 reciprocal
  anti-join precondition passes) — a winner+PV, a loser (a real 0-EV EC row) with PV, and
  a UCSB analysis-only row — and asserts the live
  ``ec_pv_preferred``/``ec_pv_redistributable`` views resolve exactly as D026 requires
  (no fan-out; loser EC 0 with PV; the UCSB row never on the redistributable surface).
  The counts are invented; only the names are real (D022 forbids UCSB *bytes*, not the
  string ``'UCSB'``).

- **``test_join_over_a_real_two_source_load``** — end-to-end, doubly gated
  (``integration`` + ``USVOTE_UCSB_HTML_DIR``): real MIT + UCSB for 2016+2020, then the
  join views, asserting no fan-out and the redistributable leak-guard over reconciled data.

Config + skip-if-unset come from the shared ``integration_db_config`` fixture.
