"""Unit tests for ``usvote.pipeline``.

Covers the year-set derivation and the full scrape -> parse -> transform -> load
wiring, run offline: the 2016 + 2020 Archives fixtures replay through
``fetch_from_dir``, a fake state-geo frame is injected via ``load_geo``, and the
load lands on the recording fake connection — so the end-to-end wiring #28 adds is
exercised with no network, no TIGER shapefile, and no live Postgres. The
real-database load is covered by the integration test in
``tests/integration/test_load.py``.
