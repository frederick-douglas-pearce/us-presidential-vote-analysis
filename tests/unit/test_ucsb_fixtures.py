"""Integrity tests for the synthetic UCSB parser fixtures (#34, D022).

These do **not** exercise the #35 parser — that does not exist yet. They guard the
*fixtures themselves*: the synthetic HTML is a deliverable of this story, and its whole
value is that it reproduces the real UCSB table's structure **and its aggregation
identities** so #35's sum-validation has something true to check. Fabricated numbers
that silently stop adding up would make the fixtures a trap — a parser bug and a fixture
typo would look identical. So this locks the four identities read off the real data:

    (1) each candidate's Votes column sums exactly to the Totals row,
    (2) the TOTAL VOTE column sums exactly to the Totals row,
    (3) per state, TOTAL VOTE strictly exceeds the shown candidates (a residual "other"),
    (4) the Totals EV per candidate equals data-row EV PLUS the legislature-state
        electors apportioned in each cell's prose (D005: flagged and counted, never
        zeroed).

The small extractor below is deliberately ad hoc — just enough to read the grid, not a
preview of the real parser. It reads the state-block header to discover the candidate
count and names (never assuming a fixed width), which is also why the same test covers
both the 2- and 4-candidate-group eras.
