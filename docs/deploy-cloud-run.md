# Deploying the API — Cloud Run behind Cloudflare (E8-S7)

The public deployment of the read-only API ([decision **D034**](../.claude/specs/decisions.md)).
It graduates the D032 cloud-agnostic container (E8-S6) to a hosted service: **Cloud Run**
(scale-to-zero, single instance) fronted by **Cloudflare (free plan)** for CDN caching,
rate limiting, and bot protection — provisioned once, then redeployed by a
`workflow_dispatch` GitHub Action ([`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](../.github/workflows/deploy.yml)).

**Cost posture (the top priority):** the container scales to **zero** when idle, caps at
**one** instance, uses **request-based CPU** (billed only while serving), and Cloudflare's
edge absorbs repeat reads so the origin is rarely woken. A **budget kill-switch** caps the
worst case. At this project's traffic, expect to sit inside the Cloud Run free tier (≈ $0).

> **You run the provisioning** (steps 1–7) with your own GCP + Cloudflare credentials — the
> repo ships the glue, not access to your cloud. After that, refreshing data is one click
> (§8). Do the steps **in order**: Cloudflare's rate-limits + origin secret are configured
> **before** the origin is locked to Cloudflare, so there is never an unprotected public
> window.

## 0. Prerequisites

- A **GCP project** with billing enabled (see the [README quick commands](../README.md)).
- A **domain you control** on **Cloudflare** (free plan). One domain serves both this API
  (`api.<domain>`) and a future dashboard (`<domain>` / `www` on GitHub Pages). Cloudflare
  Registrar sells at wholesale cost and auto-wires DNS.
- `gcloud` authenticated locally (`gcloud auth login`) for the one-time setup.

Set shell variables (adjust to your names):

```
PROJECT=usvote-api
REGION=us-west1
REPO=usvote                       # Artifact Registry repo
SERVICE=usvote-api                # Cloud Run service
BUCKET=gs://${PROJECT}-snapshots  # private snapshot bucket
GH_REPO=frederick-douglas-pearce/us-presidential-vote-analysis
```

## 1. Enable APIs

```
gcloud config set project "$PROJECT"
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com artifactregistry.googleapis.com \
  secretmanager.googleapis.com iamcredentials.googleapis.com sts.googleapis.com \
  storage.googleapis.com
```

## 2. Artifact Registry + the private snapshot bucket

```
gcloud artifacts repositories create "$REPO" --repository-format=docker --location="$REGION"

gcloud storage buckets create "$BUCKET" --location="$REGION" --uniform-bucket-level-access
gcloud storage buckets update "$BUCKET" --versioning   # rollback a bad snapshot upload
```

## 3. Two least-privilege service accounts (D034 fork 5)

A **deploy** SA (used by CI via WIF) and a separate **runtime** SA (what the service runs
as). The deploy SA can push/deploy but **cannot** read the origin secret; the runtime SA
can read only that secret.

```
# Runtime SA — the identity the Cloud Run service runs as.
gcloud iam service-accounts create usvote-api-run --display-name="usvote API runtime"
RUNTIME_SA="usvote-api-run@${PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

# Deploy SA — assumed by GitHub Actions through WIF.
gcloud iam service-accounts create usvote-api-deploy --display-name="usvote API deploy"
DEPLOY_SA="usvote-api-deploy@${PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

# Deploy SA permissions (no secretAccessor!).
for ROLE in roles/run.admin roles/artifactregistry.writer roles/iam.serviceAccountUser; do
  gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "$PROJECT" --member="serviceAccount:${DEPLOY_SA}" --role="$ROLE"
done
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding "$BUCKET" \
  --member="serviceAccount:${DEPLOY_SA}" --role=roles/storage.objectViewer
# Let the deploy SA deploy a service that RUNS AS the runtime SA.
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding "$RUNTIME_SA" \
  --member="serviceAccount:${DEPLOY_SA}" --role=roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
```

## 4. Origin secret in Secret Manager (D034 fork 2)

A random shared secret. The Cloudflare Worker (§7) injects it as a header on every proxied
request; the app rejects any `/v1` request that lacks it, so bots can't bypass the edge by
hitting the raw `run.app` URL. The **runtime** SA (only) can read it.

**Store it with `printf '%s'`, not a bare `openssl … | gcloud`.** `openssl rand -hex 32`
appends a trailing newline; piped straight in, that `\n` is stored *in* the secret and Cloud
Run injects it — so the origin lock **403s forever** (the Worker's clean header value never
matches `value + \n`). `printf '%s' "$(…)"` strips it. (`openssl` also sidesteps the repo's
pyenv `python` pin, which can silently create an empty secret.)

```
printf '%s' "$(openssl rand -hex 32)" | \
  gcloud secrets create usvote-origin-secret --data-file=- --replication-policy=automatic
gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding usvote-origin-secret \
  --member="serviceAccount:${RUNTIME_SA}" --role=roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor
# Note the value — you'll paste it into the Worker's ORIGIN_SECRET secret in §7.
gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=usvote-origin-secret
```

## 5. Workload Identity Federation — keyless CI auth (D034 fork 5)

No long-lived key. **Attribute-lock the provider to this repo** so no other GitHub repo can
impersonate the deploy SA.

```
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools create github --location=global --display-name="GitHub"
POOL=$(gcloud iam workload-identity-pools describe github --location=global --format='value(name)')

gcloud iam workload-identity-pools providers create-oidc github-actions \
  --location=global --workload-identity-pool=github \
  --display-name="GitHub Actions" \
  --issuer-uri="https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
  --attribute-mapping="google.subject=assertion.sub,attribute.repository=assertion.repository" \
  --attribute-condition="assertion.repository=='${GH_REPO}'"

# Let identities FROM THIS REPO impersonate the deploy SA.
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding "$DEPLOY_SA" \
  --role=roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \
  --member="principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/${POOL}/attribute.repository/${GH_REPO}"

gcloud iam workload-identity-pools providers describe github-actions \
  --location=global --workload-identity-pool=github --format='value(name)'
# ^ this full resource name is GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER below.
```

## 6. Build the snapshot and upload it (D034 fork 1; AC4 refresh path)

The snapshot can only be built from the local warehouse (needs Postgres). CI never builds
it — it's a **data input** pulled from GCS.

Run these with `uv run` so the project's managed Python 3.14 + all deps are used (a bare
`python` hits the pyenv `.python-version` pin — see §4):

```
# Build the warehouse + snapshot locally (see README "Local smoke test").
uv run python -m usvote corpus            # optional: refresh $USVOTE_EC_HTML_DIR first (#89)
uv run python -m usvote all
uv run python -m usvote.snapshot          # writes $USVOTE_API_SNAPSHOT_PATH
gcloud storage cp "$USVOTE_API_SNAPSHOT_PATH" "${BUCKET}/api_snapshot.sqlite"
```

**A UCSB-bearing build also runs the D017 layer-3 overlap gates** (#167 / D051) as its last
step, after every view exists. They compare MIT against UCSB and **skip** when UCSB is absent,
so an EC + MIT build is unaffected. A breach exits `1` with the offending keys named and the
warehouse already fully built — the data is in place and only the cross-source agreement check
failed, so re-running with `--replace` rebuilds the same facts and re-hits the same breach.
`--no-validate-overlap` accepts the build if the thresholds are the thing under review (D051
expects gate 1's per-year floor to be the first to need it).

Env vars this step reads: `USVOTE_SHAPEFILE_PATH`, `USVOTE_MIT_CSV_PATH`, `PG*`, and
`USVOTE_API_SNAPSHOT_PATH` as the output. Two optional ones change **where the data comes
from**: `USVOTE_UCSB_HTML_DIR` (adds the UCSB popular-vote control) and `USVOTE_EC_HTML_DIR`
(rebuilds the EC spine from the local Archives corpus instead of scraping — see the caveat in
§8 before relying on it for a refresh).

`usvote all` is a create-if-absent load — it assumes empty tables. If the warehouse **already
has data** (you've built it before), a bare `all` fails with
`UniqueViolation: … "state_pkey" … Key (state)=(Alabama) already exists`. Use **`--replace`**
for a clean rebuild (drops + recreates the `dwh` schema, re-scrapes, reloads — destructive to
the local warehouse only):

```
uv run python -m usvote all --replace     # rebuild an already-populated warehouse from scratch
uv run python -m usvote.snapshot
gcloud storage cp "$USVOTE_API_SNAPSHOT_PATH" "${BUCKET}/api_snapshot.sqlite"
```

**Redistributable-only (AC5)** is guaranteed at the source: the snapshot is built from
`ec_pv_redistributable` (MIT/CC0 only, [D030](../.claude/specs/decisions.md)), re-asserted at
build time. Nothing non-redistributable can reach the bucket or the hosted service.

## 7. Configure GitHub + Cloudflare, then deploy

**GitHub → repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions.** Set **Variables**:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `GCP_PROJECT_ID` | `$PROJECT` |
| `GCP_REGION` | `us-west1` |
| `GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` | the full provider resource name from §5 |
| `GCP_DEPLOY_SA` | `$DEPLOY_SA` |
| `GCP_RUNTIME_SA` | `$RUNTIME_SA` |
| `ARTIFACT_IMAGE` | `us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT/usvote/usvote-api` |
| `SNAPSHOT_GCS_URI` | `${BUCKET}/api_snapshot.sqlite` |
| `CLOUD_RUN_SERVICE` | `$SERVICE` |
| `API_CORS_ORIGINS` | your dashboard origin(s), comma-separated (never `*`) |
| `ORIGIN_SECRET_NAME` | `usvote-origin-secret` |
| `CLOUDFLARE_HOSTNAME` | `api.<domain>` — **don't create it for the first deploy** (see note) |

> **`CLOUDFLARE_HOSTNAME`:** simply *don't create the variable* for the first (origin-only)
> deploy — a variable that doesn't exist reads as empty and the workflow skips the Cloudflare
> steps. Do **not** set a placeholder like `NA`: a non-empty value makes the purge + smoke
> steps run and fail (the Cloudflare secrets aren't set yet).

Add a protected **`production` Environment** (Settings → Environments) with yourself as a
**required reviewer** — a human gate on this irreversible public deploy. The reviewer rule
must sit on the environment named exactly **`production`** (what the workflow references); a
differently-named environment is ignored.

**First deploy (origin still open, no public DNS yet):** run **Actions → Deploy (Cloud Run)
→ Run workflow**. It builds, pushes, deploys, and asserts `/health`. Grab the `run.app` URL
from the deploy log.

**Cloudflare setup — a Worker front door** (now that the service exists). Cloud Run's
`run.app` endpoint routes by the HTTP `Host` header, so a plain proxied `CNAME api → run.app`
returns a **Google 404** (Cloudflare forwards the visitor's `Host: api.<domain>`, which Cloud
Run doesn't recognize). Rewriting the Host needs Cloudflare's Origin Rules "Host Header
Override" — **paywalled on the free plan** — so a free **Worker** does it instead, and also
injects the origin secret and caches `/v1` at the edge (this replaces the DNS/Cache-Rule/
Transform-Rule steps a paid plan would use; see [D035](../.claude/specs/decisions.md)).

1. **Create the Worker.** Workers & Pages → Create → **Start with Hello World!** → name it
   `usvote-api-proxy` → Deploy → **Edit code**, replace the scaffold with this (set `ORIGIN`
   to your `run.app` URL from the first deploy), and Deploy:
   ```js
   export default {
     async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
       const ORIGIN = "https://<service>-<projnum>.<region>.run.app"; // your run.app URL
       const url = new URL(request.url);
       const cacheable = request.method === "GET" && url.pathname.startsWith("/v1");
       const cache = caches.default;
       if (cacheable) { const hit = await cache.match(request); if (hit) return hit; }

       // Rebuilding against the run.app URL makes the outbound Host = run.app (fixes the
       // Google 404); then inject the origin secret from the Worker secret binding.
       const req = new Request(ORIGIN + url.pathname + url.search, request);
       req.headers.set("X-Usvote-Origin-Secret", env.ORIGIN_SECRET);
       let resp = await fetch(req);

       // Cache only successful /v1 responses: long EDGE hold (s-maxage) so the zero-scaled
       // origin isn't woken between versions; moderate BROWSER max-age so a bug-fix deploy
       // reflects promptly. Purged on deploy (purge_everything clears caches.default).
       if (cacheable && resp.status === 200) {
         resp = new Response(resp.body, resp);
         resp.headers.set(
           "Cache-Control",
           "public, max-age=3600, s-maxage=2592000, stale-while-revalidate=86400"
         );
         ctx.waitUntil(cache.put(request, resp.clone()));
       }
       return resp;
     },
   };
   ```
2. **Bind the secret.** Worker → Settings → Variables and Secrets → add a **Secret** named
   `ORIGIN_SECRET` = the value from §4 (no trailing space/newline) → Deploy.
3. **Route it.** Worker → Settings → Domains & Routes → Add → **Custom Domain** →
   `api.<domain>` (auto-creates the proxied DNS + cert). SSL/TLS mode → **Full (strict)**.
   Test: `curl https://api.<domain>/health` → 200.
4. **Rate limiting** (the Worker does NOT rate-limit): Security → WAF → Rate limiting rules →
   `Hostname eq api.<domain> and URI Path starts_with "/v1"` → 60 req/min per IP → Block.
   Enable **Bot Fight Mode** (Security → Bots).
5. **Zone ID + Cache-Purge token:** zone Overview → copy the **Zone ID**; My Profile → API
   Tokens → create a token scoped to **Zone · Cache Purge** on this zone only.

**Wire Cloudflare into CI:** set the GitHub **Secrets** `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` +
`CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID` and the **Variable** `CLOUDFLARE_HOSTNAME = api.<domain>`, then **re-run
the workflow**. Now the raw `run.app` `/v1` returns **403** while `https://api.<domain>/v1`
returns **200** through the cached, rate-limited edge — the post-deploy smoke asserts both.

> **If the smoke step fails on `cloudflare /v1` (#148).** It runs immediately after the cache
> purge and revision cutover, and this assertion false-failed on both of the first two
> deploys while the deploy itself was fine — healing on its own within minutes each time. It
> now uses a **per-run cache-buster** (`?deploy_smoke=$GITHUB_RUN_ID`) so a 403 cached at the
> runner's edge colo during cutover cannot be replayed to every retry, plus a longer budget
> (45 tries ≈ 3 min) for that check alone.
>
> **Before assuming a repeat is benign, check the one thing that matters:** that the raw
> `run.app` `/v1` still returns **403**. `https://api.<domain>/v1` returning 200 is *also*
> what you would see if the origin lock had fallen open, so "it works now" is not by itself
> evidence the deploy is healthy — the pair is.

## 8. Refreshing the data (the snapshot-refresh story, AC4)

Data changes rarely (a bug fix, or every ~4 years for a new election):

```
uv run python -m usvote corpus                                    # refresh the Archives HTML first
uv run python -m usvote all && uv run python -m usvote.snapshot   # rebuild from the warehouse
gcloud storage cp "$USVOTE_API_SNAPSHOT_PATH" "${BUCKET}/api_snapshot.sqlite"
```

> **Read this before refreshing (#89 / D036).** If `USVOTE_EC_HTML_DIR` is set, `usvote all`
> rebuilds from the **local Archives corpus** rather than scraping — that is the point of the
> corpus (a rebuild costs zero requests instead of ~50 against a site asking for a 10-second
> crawl delay), but it means the rebuild replays **saved bytes**.
>
> Consequences to hold in mind:
> - **A new election year is caught.** The corpus completeness guard fails loudly the moment
>   `LATEST_ELECTION_YEAR` moves past what the corpus holds, naming the stale directory.
> - **An in-place Archives correction is NOT caught.** A page that is present and 200 is never
>   re-fetched, so a corrected footnote or elector count would be replayed indefinitely.
> - **An unchanged `snapshot_version` therefore means the *bytes* were unchanged — not that the
>   Archives were checked.** A stale-corpus rebuild is *safe* (no wrong data ships; the API keeps
>   serving the previous correct version) but it is **uninformative**, and nothing downstream
>   distinguishes it from "nothing changed upstream".
>
> So: run `usvote corpus` **first** whenever you are refreshing because you expect new or
> corrected data. The rebuild prints the corpus's page count and fetch-date range — check it. To
> force a live scrape instead, pass `--no-corpus`. To re-fetch one suspect year, delete that
> `<year>.html` and re-run `usvote corpus`.

Then **Actions → Deploy (Cloud Run) → Run workflow**. The image is tagged with the new
`snapshot_version`, Cloud Run cuts over, and the workflow **purges Cloudflare after cutover**
so the edge refills from the new revision. Because the ETag is the content hash, clients
holding the old version revalidate and get the fresh data automatically.

## 9. Budget kill-switch (recommended — Cloud Run has no native hard cost cap)

See [`deploy/killswitch/`](../deploy/killswitch/): a tiny Cloud Function that, on a Billing
Budget Pub/Sub alert crossing your threshold, sets the service to `--max-instances=0`
(effectively pausing it) so a runaway bill is impossible. Also set plain **budget email
alerts** at 50/90/100% (Billing → Budgets & alerts). At free-tier traffic you'll never hit
it — it's the backstop, not the plan.

## What this does NOT do

- No live database anywhere ([D028](../.claude/specs/decisions.md)) — the snapshot is baked
  into the image; Postgres is touched only when *building* the snapshot locally.
- No non-redistributable data is ever served ([D030](../.claude/specs/decisions.md)).
- The image stays cloud-agnostic ([D032](../.claude/specs/decisions.md)): a provider swap
  (Fly.io/Render) touches only `deploy.yml`, never the app or the image.
